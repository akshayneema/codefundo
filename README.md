# Project Idea
The idea is to make a Crisis Response App that will use the details obtained through geospatial information and crowdsourcing by rescuers and the victims(if possible) to find out the best route between rescue camps and the affected site. The best route is defined as the route which minimizes the danger of being affected by the calamity throughout the route. This app will help rescuers at different rescue stations and victims to contribute for more organized and effective search operations.
